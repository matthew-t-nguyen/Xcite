My friends and I developed Xcite, which was awarded Top 5 üèÜ at the 2024 X Developer Challenge (formerly Twitter) out of ~35 teams and ~120 participants! Huge shoutout to my teammates‚ÄîI couldn't do this without them: Lucas Johansson, Rakhi C, Elden Yap.

üåü Our Project: We developed Xcite, a full-stack web application that features a suite of engaging games designed for players to interact with posts made by their favorite X accounts directly through the game interface.

üéÆ Highlight Games:
1. "Who Said That?" - Inspired by NYT Connections, this game randomizes a 4x4 board of iconic posts (tweets) made by celebrities and challenges players to categorize the posts based on who wrote them. The game also features an advanced "Hint" system powered by the xAI SDK (Grok) that delivers clues about one of the celebrities used in the game. After the game finishes, the user is able to Like, Repost, and Follow any of the posts or X accounts they saw in the game. Furthermore, users can customize the X accounts used in the game, e.g. users can input their own X accounts and/or their friends' accounts!

2. "Higher or Lower?" - In our second game, users test their intuition by selecting which of two posts from a random X celebrity account has more likes. With each correct guess, players build a winning streak, unlocking new posts to compare. As with the first game, users can Like, Repost, and Follow the X posts/accounts they see in the game!

üíª Technologies Used: We utilized React and Tailwind CSS for our front-end, while the back-end was powered by Flask, X API v2, and the xAI SDK (Grok). We also implemented OAuth to manage user authentication, enabling our web application to Like, Repost, and Follow X content on the user's behalf in a secure manner.

A huge thank you to the X developers and xAI team for organizing a great event and making this such a memorable experience. Looking forward to more such events and continuing to build cool projects with cool people!
